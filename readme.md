# To run the Rust examples on a Windows machine, you'll need to set up Rust and create simple projects. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## 1. Install Rust on Windows

    - Visit rustup.rs
    - Download and run the rustup-init.exe file
    - Follow the prompts (the default installation is usually fine)
    - After installation, restart your command prompt or PowerShell

You can verify the installation by opening a new command prompt or PowerShell window and typing:

```rustc --version```
```cargo --version```

## 2. Create a Project and Run Examples

For each example, the easiest way is to use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell

Create a new project:

```
cargo new rust_practice
cd rust_practice
```

Replace the content of ```src/main.rs``` with any example from the guide
Run the example:

```cargo run```


## 3. For Individual Examples Without Creating a Project

For quick tests of simple examples:

Create a file with a .rs extension (e.g., example.rs)
Copy an example into the file
Make sure it has a main() function:
```
fn main() {
    // Example code here
}
```
Compile and run:
```
rustc example.rs
./example
```

## 4. Using an IDE (recommended)
For a better development experience:

- Install Visual Studio Code
- Install the "rust-analyzer" extension
- Open your rust project folder in VS Code

Enjoy features like code completion, error highlighting, and more

## 5. Using Rust Playground
If you want to try examples without installing anything:

Visit play.rust-lang.org
Paste the example code
Click "Run" to see the output

For the practice problems in the guide, I recommend creating a new Cargo project for each section and implementing the solutions there. This will give you experience with the full Rust development workflow.
